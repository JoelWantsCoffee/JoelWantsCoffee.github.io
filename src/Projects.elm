## Haskell Polynomial Factoring [[GitHub](https://github.com/JoelWantsCoffee/Haskell-Polynomials)]
My honours thesis project - polynomial factoring in Haskell. The project includes all of the computer-algebra pieces needed to factor polynomials over the integers and finite fields, all built from the ground up.

## Distressed Study Timer [[GitHub](https://github.com/JoelWantsCoffee/uni-timer)] [[Website](/uni-timer)]
This is a pomodoro study timer that I coded up during the first year of my undergrad. Somehow, it's continued to find use ever after my graduation in 2022. The background (drawn in microsoft paint) attempts to capture the atmosphere present in Room 102 of the UQ Social Sciences Annexe (Building 31A) during the SWOTVAC of Semester 2, 2019.
