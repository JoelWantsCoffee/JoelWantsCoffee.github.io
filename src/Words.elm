# Service Desk One

I cross the room and make it to the service desk. Service desk one. I place my things on the counter and look to the small lady sitting opposite me. Her eyes are fixed on me. 

> What are you here for?

Her eyes snap down to the counter, to my forms and my id. She answers her own question. 

> A working with children's check.

She says it flatly, her mind obviously elsewhere. Her eyes drift further down the counter and come to rest on the remnants of my lunch: a plastic tray, covered in quick-sale tags, labelled *chopped fruit*.

> Lunch!
> Lunch is good!
> I just had lunch too.
> Don't worry, I'm just having some fun.

She takes up my forms and starts entering something into her computer. She types for a minute then stops and looks at me.

> No. 
> This is your first time here?
> Why haven't you been here before?
> You're supposed to have new south wales license.
> If you're here for longer than three months, you're supposed to request a new south wales license.
> It's... no, no, don't worry.
> The police won't know how long you've been here.
> It's a technicality.
> It's up to you, whatever you want.

She turns back to her computer desk, produces a form, and places it on the counter. 

> You fill this in so you can get on the system.
> I'll do this.
> That is teamwork.

I search the counter top for a pen. She sees me looking, gets down from her chair, walks about a metre to a set of draws, and produces a fresh pen. She gives it to me.

> There are never any pens these days.
> Teamwork.
> I'm just having some fun.
> Because, look around.
> No one has fun anymore.

I turn to look around. The waiting room is full of waiting people. They don't *all* look glum---the people standing in front of counter two are laughing. I turn back to the woman.

> Queensland must be cheaper. 
> It's expensive here.

I tell her that I think Brisbane is catching up to Sydney, cost of living wise.

> It's because everyone here is running to Brisbane.
> The people in Brisbane won't like it.
> Soon all the states will be angry at each other.
> And no one will think about immigrants anymore.
> Sorry, I'm just being an immigrant. 
> I'm just having some fun.
> No one has fun anymore.
> And it doesn't even matter who you vote for.
> The greens, one nation---all of the votes will go back to the two parties.
> And they're both the same.
> Everyone is the same.

She lowers her voice conspiratorially:

> But I think labour's better.

She quickly returns to her normal volume.

> But I'm just being an immigrant.
> I'm just having fun.

She trails off for a moment, concentrating on her computer, then starts mumbling to herself as she types.

> Who are you?
> You are:
> Joel...
> William...
> Richardson...
> Do you ever think about that?

She fixes her eyes on me.

> That that isn't who really who you are?
> That that's just a name some people gave you, and other people call you?
> Do you know?
> Who are you really?

I finish filling in my form and slide it across the counter to her. She pushes my ID back to me. 

> Teamwork.

She prints off something and hands it to me---a temporary working with children's check, for use until my proper one arrives. I collect my things.

> Do you read?
> You should read this book.
> It's a wonderful book.
> The author is brilliant.

She writes the name of the book on a scrap of paper and slides it across the counter to me.

> Don't buy it though.
> You're at the university.
> You're like me -- poor.
> Get it from the library.

I tell her to have a good afternoon. I wave goodbye.

> Come back sometime.
> Tell me if you like it.
