## Algebras of the Tangent Bundle Monad (April 2025) [[Link](https://centre-of-australian-category-theory.github.io/seminar/talks/1854)] [[Slides](/data/1854slides.pdf)]
My first talk for the Australian Category Seminar. This talk introduces my MRes project, focusing on algebras of the tangent bundle monad in the category of affine schemes.

## Simplicial Sets, Simply (August 2024) [[Slides](https://uqmss.org/assets/slides/2024/wk4_joel_richardson.pdf)]
My second talk for the UQ Mathematics Student Society, introducing delta sets. In hindsight, I probably should have avoided category-theoretic terminologyâ€”it confused more than it clarified. Still, I'm very pleased with how the visuals turned out.

## Finding Factors in Berlekamp's Algebra (April 2024) [[Slides](https://uqmss.org/assets/slides/2024/wk9_joel_richardson.pdf)]
My first talk for the UQ Mathematics Student Society, exploring Berlekamp's factoring algorithm. Overall, I'm quite happy with the result.
